PROJECT 9 SAMUEL DAHL
(A mildly dank project I hope.)

So, um, uh, my friend told me about environment variables, which will be required when
you run my program.
you'll need to export the variables below. run the following commands.
(assuming your running on localhost)

  export DB_URL=mongodb://localhost
  export DB_NAME=json-faga

This is going to require a seed script as well.
